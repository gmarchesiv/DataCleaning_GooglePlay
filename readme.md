# Google Play Store Apps Analysis

## Project objective
The objective of this project is to highlight the specific characteristics of the most popular apps, by rating. I aim to answer the following questions: 
- Are ratings category sensitive?
- Are ratings price sensitive?
- Do other features such as number of reviews, number of installs or content rating have any influece on rating? 

The complete analysis is conducted in the Jupyter notebook. Annotations are done after each question and conclusions are summarized at the end of the notebook.
